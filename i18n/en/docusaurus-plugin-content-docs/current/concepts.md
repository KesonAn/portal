## go-zero

> **_Shorten distance from demand to offline_**

go-zero is a web and rpc framework that integrates various engineering practices.Flexible design guarantees stability at the same end and undergoes a full operational test.

go-Zero contains very simple API definitions and generation tools goctl. Can generate Go, iOS, Android, Kotlin, Dart, TypeScript, JavaScript code based on defined api files and can be run directly.

## Benefits of using go-zero

- Easily get stability to support millions of living services
- Intra-stage timeout control, limited flow, adaptive melting, adaptive loop and adaptive loop capability for microservice governance without configuration or extra code
- Microservice Governance Middleware can be seamlessly integrated into other existing frameworks using
- Useful API description, all end code generated by one click
- Auto-Verify Client Request Parameters
- A large number of micro-service governance and parallel development kits

## 1. go-zero framework background

At the beginning of 18 years, we decided to migrate from a single architecture of `Java+MongoDB` to a microservice architecture, after careful thought and comparison, we decided to：

- Based on Go Language
  - Efficient performance
  - Simple Syntax
  - Widespread validating engineering efficiency
  - Extreme deployment experience
  - Very low service resource cost
- Self-research micro-service frameworks
  - Many micro-service framework self-research experience
  - A faster problem location capability is required
  - Easier add new features

## 2. Thinking on go-zero framework design

With regard to the design of the framework for microservices, we expect to guarantee the stability of microservices with a special focus on research and development efficiency.So at the beginning of the design, we had some guidelines as follows:

- Stay simple, first principle
- Flexible Design, Programming for Failure
- Tools are larger than contracts and documents
- High Available
- High Conversion
- High Scalability
- Development friendly, encapsulated complexity
- Only one way to bind to do one thing

In less than half a year, we have completely migrated from `Java+MongoDB` to `Golang+MySQL` , the primary microservice system, fully online at the end of August 18, and have stabilized the rapid growth of business follow-up and ensured high availability of the entire service.

## 3. Implementation and characteristics of the go-zero project

go-zero is an integrated web and rpc framework with various engineering practices, with the following key features:

- Powerful tool support, minimum code writing
- Very simple interface
- Fully compatible net/http
- Support Middleware for Extensions
- High Performance
- Programming for failure, flexible design
- Built-in Services Discovery, Load Balancer
- Internal limit flow, melt, download, and automatically trigger, restore automatically
- API Parameters Auto-Validation
- Timeout link control
- Auto Cache Control
- Link tracking, statistics alerts, etc.
- High and sustained stability, which guarantees daily flow peaks during the epidemic

As shown below, we guarantee high availability of overall services at multiple levels：

## 4. Installation

Install under project directory：

```shell
go get -u github.com/zeromicro/go-zero
```

## 5. Quick Start

0. Full example please view

   [Quick Build High & Microservice](https://github.com/zeromicro/zero-doc/blob/main/doc/shorturl.md)

   [Quick Build High & Microservice - Multi-RPC](https://github.com/zeromicro/zero-doc/blob/main/docs/zero/bookstore.md)

1. Install goctl tools

   `goctl` read `go control`, don't read `go C-T-L`.`goctl` means not being controlled by code but to control it.The `go` does not mean `golang`.

   ```shell
   go get -u github.com/zeromicro/go-zero/tools/goctl
   ```

   If using version go1.16, you can install the `go install` command

   ```shell
   go install github.com/zeromicro/go-zero/tools/goctl@latest
   ```

   Make sure goctl is executable

2. Quickly generate api service

   ```shell
   goctl api new greet
   cd greet
   go mod init
   go mod tidy
   go run greet.go -f etc/greet-api.yaml
   ```

   Default listener at 8888 port (can be modified in configuration file), can request by curl：

   ```shell
   curl -i http://localhost:8888/from/you
   ```

   Return to the following：

   ```http
   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
   Traceparent: 00-45fa9e7a7c505bad3a53a024e425ace9-eb5787234cf3e308-00
   Date: Thu, 22 Oct 2020 14:03:18 GMT
   Content-Length: 14
   ```

   Write business code：

    ```plain
    * api file defines the routing of the service to be exposed, reference [api norms](https://github.com/zeromicro/zero-doc/blob/main/go-zero.dev/cn/api-grammar.md)
    * Can pass dependencies to logic, such as mysql, redis and so on in servicecontext.go
    * Add business processing logic to the get/post/put/delete request
    ```

3. Java, TypeScript, Dart, JavaScript code can be generated from api files

   ```shell
   goctl api java -api greet.api -dir greet
   goctl api dart -api greet.api -dir greet
   ...
   ```

You can set out in the group where improvements are needed, and we will consider reasonableness and modify it as soon as possible.

If you find **_bugs_** please submit them in a timely manner **_issue_**we will confirm and modify them as soon as possible.

Add my previous point **_star_**, a small **_star_** is the power of authors to answer the question of the volume: handshake:
